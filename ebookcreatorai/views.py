    # Swearing, "I am Captain Able!"

    # It became his mystic ocean.
    # Through waves of foam, he'd bravely leap,
    # A devotion to maritime motion.

    # Left them in a state of muck.

    # By his clever schemes did fascinate.

    # His courage refine, his spirit bold,
    # His voyage never teared.

    # Gavin, smiling, took the charge,
    # Like a real seafarer's daughter.

    # Lies a hidden starry treasure.
    # "To all brave boys and hearty girls,
    # The sky's the limit - no bottom measure!"
    
    # Perseverance, the key Gavin found,
    # In every wave and fearsome weather.
    # Through his twists and turns around,
    # Kept his cardboard ship together.
    
    # So now he sails under the bath time light,
    # Laughing at sea's cruel caper.
    # In the world beneath the frothy white,
    # Gavin always found his paper.
